###use information

'''
- UUID
- username
- password

I used three textfieldView to edit them ,and we can changed username and password text.
But the uuid is always the same ,sure, it is still your device's uuid,just couldn't changed it.
Anyway you can fix it.

##Last but not least

'''
you should try uninstall this app, then install it again ,to check it is still the same word in textfieldView,
make sure the keychain is worked. 
Thanks to read!
